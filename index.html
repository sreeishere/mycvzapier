  <h3>A Cover Letter - Straight from the Heart</h3>
  <p>I have 7 years of experience in customer support roles and have worked in a diverse range of settings. I really enjoy helping people solve issues and I have delivered some delightful customer experiences in my journey so far and had some great comments like "you single handedly saved your organization from loosing a loyal customer and bad reputation" on the way.</p>
  <p>I always have passion and eagerness to learn something new therefore currently I am pursuing a course in Full stack development and yes I do have some basic knowledge on API's.</p>
  <p>I am a fast learner and I can guarentee that I can learn any product/SaaS super-fast and be up and running in no time which would definitely help my supervisors in concentrating on other commercial goals as many organizations have a fast-paced environment.</p>
  <p>I have really good organizational skills and I am flexible to work in any time zones (or whenever my supervisor need me)</p>
  <p>I am a high performer and I constatly strive for the best results. I have received couple of best performer awards (one quite recently during the pandemic which means I am very comfortable working remotely) from my previous organizations and the Extra Mile award for bringing local cost optimization. I promise that I would work hard in bringing innovations to your organization as well.</p>
  <p>I love working individually or in a team environment. I will be really greatful if you could help me to become part of your diverse team.</p>
  <p>If you are a talent acquisition specialist, if you find my profile interesting or a good fit for the role, it would mean the world to me if you could set up an interview with the hiring manager.</p>
